This year I've been in a journey to be more comfortable with my window manager/desktop, `dwm` served me well for a long time, but I needed more flexibility and ease of configuration.

My journey came to an end for now, with [i3][i3], a tiling window manager with [a very good documentation][i3-doc] and very similar to `dwm` functionality-wise.

For the status bar I am using [py3status][py3status], which is a Python library for *i3* that works. The code could be better, but It's easy to create your own plugins, [I have started two for now][py3status2].

My i3 configuration can be found in my [dotfiles][dotfiles].

A good reference on [how to start with i3 on ArchLinux][arch_reference].
