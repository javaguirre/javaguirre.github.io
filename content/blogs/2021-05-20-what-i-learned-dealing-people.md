Focusing on people (1-1, Nailted), processes
(improving Scrum, Metrics, user story mapping, speed),
products (new launches will be released this year
and current products.

(Drive, from Pink, Non-violent communication, How to make a friend... Carnegie), Career path.

I have made many mistakes in my career, I
still do, but I believe I learned from most of
them and I will continue learning.

In these past years, I realized I had to focus on
learning technology but the most important is
people.

I have been a fast learner regarding technology and
book-related stuff (or also spent many hours on it),
but I haven't been aware of
how important was to focus on improving how I
interact with people, the most important skill and
the most underestimated in technology IMHO.

We want to be great at Python, and deliver faster,
code quality, but how about interacting with
people? How to treat your teammates, how about solving
arguments? How about dealing with complicated
clients? Or conflicts between teammates?

I've failed hard on this many times, and I've been
studying a lot about it, but the most important is practice.
When you're in a difficult situation is difficult to
remember the rules you wanted to apply and you wanted to communicate them.
Although with a little bit of practice
you can improve and behave better in
situations where you were failing miserably before.

Everything is about empathy and feeling the other
person needs and the necessity for everybody to feel important.

I guess some of you would think this enters
in the psychology field, I know nothing
about psychology, but I know I want to
make the best of my interactions with
my kids, my family, my teammates, and all
this is possible with an effort on
our part. It's trainable and I think we should (at least I am).

## Conclusion

Psychology on startups and agencies, be emphatic
and listening is one if not the most important skill
we need to have as teammates and leaders to
understand our environment.

Be more in other people shoes when we want something or were disappointed on
someone's behavior.
