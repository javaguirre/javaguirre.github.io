Last week I spent some time working on two themes based on [the one I use for Emacs, Ample][emacs], the [ample theme][ample] and the [ample light theme][ample-light].

Version 0.3.0 of the **Ample** syntax theme. To install It `apm install ample-syntax` on the command line.

Version 0.1.0 of the **Ample Light** for Atom. To install It `apm install ample-light-syntax` on the command line.

I am not still 100% comfortable with the **ample light theme**, but We'll get there. :-)
