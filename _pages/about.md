Hi! I'm Javier Aguirre, software architect and team leader, cofounder @ [The Neon Project](https://theneonproject.org).

I am happy guy who likes what he does for a living, learning and solving all kind of problems with software, healthy environments and nice people.

I like to release my solutions whenever possible, It's a good way of giving back to the community, improving your coding skills and learning from others. I use Github and my personal blog for that.

[The Neon Project](https://theneonproject.org) is an agency for the digital transformation on People, Processes and Products through technology, specialized in blockchain, conversational interfaces, data analysis, and complex problems.
