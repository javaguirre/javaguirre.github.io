I've been working as a *Full Stack engineer* until the release back in September 2014.

Now I am responsible of the systems and the backend architecture and development. We work in an agile environment using *Scrum*.

Our systems have a mix of technologies such as PHP and Symfony for the Web/API Backend, Python and Tornado for the Chat and alerts backend and ReactJS and Websockets for certain interactions in the frontend among other technologies.

We used an structure of microservices for several services (chat, search alerts, etc), a very accurate search engine configuration and a good monitorization and automation of deploy using Ansible in our different servers.
