Hi!

I spent some time fixing some annoying bugs I had on the [comment](https://atom.io/packages/comment) package for Atom. There was a bug when the language is not supported, and another when commenting a single line, both are now fixed and published in the [`v0.6.1` version](https://github.com/javaguirre/comment/releases/tag/v0.6.1).

The package has now support for tex files too.
