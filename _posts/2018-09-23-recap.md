Quite a ride, my last post was written when I was still a member of Reply.ai, I had a
six month young girl and maintaining a couple of Atom plugins.

After almost two years of writing more or less consistently over time, I paused, started learning
guitar (something I always wanted to do), left my job at Reply to grow more proffesionally.

Now having my second child, working for our own brand [The Neon Project](https://theneonproject.org), doing other interesting projects and driving on the Blockchain highway with Hyperledger.

I gotta say I couldn't be happier right now, I searched my luck and I got rewarded, a good reminder of
not giving up and trying to be a better person every day for the people surrounding you.

This is the first of new posts I plan to write! I hope I keep up and we have something to talk about. :-)
