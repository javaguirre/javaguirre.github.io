Last week I was in Madrid and I had the opportunity to contribute a bit to [H4ckademy][h4ckademy], a great iniciative from my friend [Israel Guti√©rrez][isra].

H4ckademy is a 9 week code retreat working on open source projects, they have startups as partners providing mentorship, so as a student you are working on projects that have an impact in a company while you are improving, learning how they work.

I prepared a workshop about **Event driven and service oriented architecture**, using Golang and Coffeescript among other technologies. We also checked how we worked with It in real projects, like *Selltag*.

After the workshop I had the oportunity to check some of the projects and mentor about how to improve the code, deploying, ReactJS...

Here you have the [presentation][presentation] and the [code][gh] of the workshop.
