A couple of weeks ago I took over a package from [havber](https://github.com/havber), He didn't have time to maintain it anymore and I thought it was a good idea since I didn't like the other packages for this purpose.

[comment](https://github.com/javaguirre/comment/) for **Atom** is a very simple package, It comments the current line or multiline with a key binding.

For now I've been merging pending pull requests, adding unittests and refactoring. You can follow the development on [github](https://github.com/javaguirre/comment/issues) and install [it through the Atom package manager](https://atom.io/packages/comment). :-)
