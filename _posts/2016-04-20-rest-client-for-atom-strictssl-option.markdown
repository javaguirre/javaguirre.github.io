[@watsonjon](https://github.com/watsonjon) has implemented a [StrictSSL option](https://github.com/ddavison/rest-client/pull/34) so
It's possible to use the rest client with self-signed certificates (handy for development), thank you!

We've created a new **minor version** (1.1.0), you can get It in the [Atom packages page](https://atom.io/packages/rest-client) or through the Atom editor.
