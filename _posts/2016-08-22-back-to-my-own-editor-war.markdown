When I thought I was gonna keep using **Emacs** I realised I needed to overcome some performance problems that weren't easy to fix. That made me start my research again.

With Emacs my main problem is the fuzzy search in `helm-projectile`, when you have a big project the search is very slow or it just hangs. I know I could do some profiling to get the real problem, but I ain't have the time for it now. The linter is slow, the motion sometimes is slow too. I will probably tweak when the linter gets triggered.

I tried with **Atom**, actually I collaborate in [two](https://atom.io/packages/comment) [packages](https://atom.io/packages/rest-client) and have [two syntax](https://atom.io/themes/ample-syntax) [themes](https://atom.io/themes/jellybeans) published, but:

- The search is also slow sometimes.
- Some packages just get broken, like `ex-mode` a week ago

or

- the packages aren't mature enough.

and

- the motion transition is sometimes very slow.
- the undo history sometimes gets broken

For now I've decided to give *Sublime Text 3* a try, and I got my nice shortcuts working easily and fast within a day. The configuration is easy, the packages are mature and work well, I can do everything I needed from Sublime and I'm happy with it. :-)

Sublime solved my problems for now.
