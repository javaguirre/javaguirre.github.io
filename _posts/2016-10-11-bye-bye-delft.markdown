After four years living in this amazing city we moved back to Spain, Cordoba.

It's been an incredible experience, personally and professionally, I've worked in many different startups, companies and projects, learned a lot and lived a peaceful and relaxed life there. I'm gonna miss a lot of things, but sometimes it's the right time for another change, a new challenge or just go back to your roots.

At some point you miss your family and your culture, and now that we're having a child we thought it was a great moment to go back and settle in the sunny south of Spain. Priorities change too.

I can only have good words for a beautiful experience in the Netherlands, so many ideas that I'd like to carry with me in this new phase of my life.
